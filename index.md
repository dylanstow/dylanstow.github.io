## Welcome!

Welcome to the home page of Dylan Stow. I am a Computer Engineering PhD Candidate at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I work with my advisor [Professor Yuan Xie](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~yuanxie/) in the [Scalable Energy-Efficient Architecture Lab (SEAL).](https://seal.ece.ucsb.edu/)

As Moore's Law reaches its limits, record levels of complexity are complicating the tasks of integrated circuit design, verification, and layout. At the same time, each new process technology is yielding smaller efficiency improvements. To continue to improve compute performance without traditional scaling, it may be necessary to specialize processors for specific workloads, but increased costs limit the economic viability of this compute diversity. To combat these trends, my primary research goals are therefore to:
+ *Increase the diversity and specialization* of computer hardware to improve performance and efficiency and to
+ *Decrease the design and manufacturing costs* of semiconductor systems to facilitate this integrated circuit diversity.

To meet these goals, my research leverages emerging packaging and learning technologies to reduce design and fabrication costs. First, my research investigates the usage of **Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuit Technology** to reduce manufacturing costs through yield improvement and to reduce design costs through layout reuse. I am also investigating the possibile uses of emerging **Machine Learning** techniques to assist in the tasks of architecture exploration and circuit layout optimization. By reducing both the recurring manufacturing costs and non-recurring design and photomask costs, it may be viable to produce a diverse ecosystem of specialized modules that can be composably integrated using new packaging technologies.

## Welcome!

Welcome to the home page of Dylan Stow. I am a Computer Engineering PhD Candidate at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I work with my advisor [Professor Yuan Xie](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~yuanxie/) in the [Scalable Energy-Efficient Architecture Lab (SEAL).](https://seal.ece.ucsb.edu/)

As Moore's Law reaches its limits, record levels of complexity are complicating the tasks of integrated circuit design, verification, and layout. At the same time, each new process technology is yielding diminishing efficiency improvements. Accordingly, my primary research goals are to:
+ Increase the diversity and specialization of computer hardware to improve efficiency
+ Decrease the costs of semiconductor design and manufacturing to facilitate integrated circuit diversity.

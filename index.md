## Welcome!

Welcome to the home page of Dylan Stow. I am a Computer Engineering PhD Candidate at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I work with my advisor [Professor Yuan Xie](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~yuanxie/) in the [Scalable Energy-Efficient Architecture Lab (SEAL).](https://seal.ece.ucsb.edu/)

My research goals are to:
+ increase the diversity and specialization of computer hardware while 
+ simultaneously decreasing the costs of design and manufacturing.
